# __<span style="color:#D57500">GlyQ-IQ</span>__
GlyQ-IQ is software that performs a targeted, chromatographic centric search of mass spectral data for glycans. The software uses a list of glycan targets to search for expected features in MS1 spectra. Features are characterized by monoisotopic mass, elution time, and isotopic fit score.  Features are annotated by glycan family relationships and in-source fragmentation patterns.

Note: GlyQ-IQ is provided on an as-is basis and is no longer supported.
